ELFIO is a header-only C++ library intended for reading and generating
files in the ELF binary format. It is used as a standalone library - it is not
dependant on any other product or project. Adhering to ISO C++, it compiles on
a wide variety of architectures and compilers.

The full library documentation can be found in *[ELFIO - Tutorial and User Manual](http://elfio.sourceforge.net/elfio.pdf)*.
